Web UI
======

There are plans to create a web-based UI for Seamless Karma, but they haven't
yet materialized: the author is more interested in building out the API.
Nonetheless, there is an infrastructure all set up for a client-side
Javascript application using require.js and Angular.js. I just need to
learn Angular first. :)
