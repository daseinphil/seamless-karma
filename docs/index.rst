Seamless Karma
==============

Seamless_ is a website that allows you to order food for delivery or takeout. In addition to individual orders, they also have a corporate program where a business allow its employees to order lunch through Seamless, and allocate a certain amount of money per employee per day to pay for that lunch. Employees may share their allocation with other employees in the company: for example, if each employee gets a $10 allocation per day, Alice can order $8 of food and give her remaining $2 to Bob, who can then order $12 of food. Or, Alice and Bob can pool their money, and together buy $20 of food.

This project is a tool to help employees efficiently manage their Seamless allocations. Your Seamless "Karma" is simply the total amount of money that other employees have used from your daily allocation, minus the total amount of money that you have used from other employees' daily allocations.
