Security
========

This project has no security whatsoever: there are no user accounts, no passwords, and anyone can change any piece of data in the system at any time. It's essentially an API layer over a SQL database. It is assumed that organizing and tracking your Seamless Karma is not a security-critical component of your infrastructure, and an authentication and permissions framework would provide needless complexity in using the application.

In layman's terms: anyone can modify their Seamless Karma at any time (or anyone else's Seamless Karma). This game only works if everyone plays by the rules. Please be nice!
